# .dotfiles
dotfiles for my arch linux. <br>
Not too much configuration, this is more for migrating from virtual machine to an actual arch installation.
# actually...
now since I solved double monitor Issue and added keyboard settings, this does have some uniqueness to it. Also i've already migrated from virtual machine to flash drive to full-blown SSD with EFI and proper SWAP so this is now my actual dotfiles repo
# ACTUALLY...
Now that I've done some ricing, this is actually useable. picom configuration, decent amount of i3 mappings, for now i just need to install rofi theme to complete my arch rice. Neovim has quite a lot of settings as well - it now works with clangd and rust-analyzer and has a lot of keymaps. 
# NOTE
if someone is crazy enough to use this: I did NOT aim for portability. you will have to change your monitor name, will have to manually create ~/Screenshots folder e.t.c.. If someone is brave enough to try thisbut you encountered some issues, I will try to help out. Also, Picom blur requires "okay" gpu - my laptop (gtx1050ti), for example, could not handle it at all, while pc(rtx3050) handles it easily.
