# / 
This is a directory relative to which I will be storing system-wide configuration, scripts e.t.c.
# update.sh
This script will be used to copy all of the tracked files from system to this folder
# tracked 
a file which contains list of tracked files 
# Why?
I don't want to add separate repo for my scripts. also, this way i will not forget what I wrote and where I placed my scripts
